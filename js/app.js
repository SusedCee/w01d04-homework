console.log("HW");


//VERBAL QUESTIONS

//1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
   //A parameter is a variable listed that is part of the function. (inside)
   //An argument is a variable that is given to the function when told to. (out)


//2. Within a function, what is the difference between return and console.log?
   //A function stores the data in the memory
   //console.log only writes it into the console. It's also a cool tool to check work.


//3. What are the implications of the ability of a function to return a value?
	// Return functions cannot be checked in the console and you cannot write code 
	//after the return function.
